# ll_insertions
manipulating linked lists
## Challenge
For this code challenge we had to make methods that would append which adds a new node with the given value to the end
of the list, Insertbefore which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node, and
insertAfter which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node,
## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was just too while loop through the lists till I got to the point I needed to be at and them exicute the
method .And it would be a big O(n) for both time and space.
