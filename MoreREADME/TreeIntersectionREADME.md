# Intersection of binary trees
Hash Table code challenge
## Challenge
for the Intersection of binary trees code challenge we where tasked with creating a method that takes in two binary
trees and returns a set of values found in both trees.
## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to take two hashSets and save all the node values of the first tree to the first hash set and then
the node values to the second tree and if they are already saved on the first hashSet to save it to the second HashSet
## Solution
