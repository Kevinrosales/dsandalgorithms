# Multi-bracket Validation.
Stacks and Queue code challenge
## Challenge
Our task was to create a method that checks to see if brackets are paired and semantically correct.
## Approach & Efficiency
I chose to use a stack that only takes in opening brackets and iterates through the given sting while peeking and
comparing them to the top of the stack. this would be BigO O(n) for Time an O(n) for space.
