Graph Methods
## Challenge
For this Lab we where tasked with creating a graph. the graph should start by having a addNode method, and a addEdge
method. Each Node should have assigned weight. The other set of methods we had to add where the GetNodes method where
it would Return all of the nodes in the graph, the GetNeighbors method which takes in a node and Returns a collection
of nodes connected to the given node Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection, and a size method
that returns the number of nodes in the graph.
