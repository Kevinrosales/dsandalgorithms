# Hashtables
Making a hashtable
## Challenge
For this lab we had to create a hashTable with a add method that takes in a Key and Value, hashes the key and adds it
to the hashtable, a find method that takes in a key and value and returns the value from the key/value pair, a contains
method that checks to see if the key exists in the hashTable, and a getHash method that takes in a key and returns the
index of the array the key is stored in.
